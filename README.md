# Current state
* app 1: ".exe" platform + hot reloadable ".dll" game module
* app 2: ".exe" only console, written in C++
* app 3: ".exe" only console, written in C
* abstract data structures and algorithms

# To do
* read the pathtracing book, implement
* finish pacman
* data with handles instead of pointers
* memory management
* assets management
* "Entity Component System" framework
* physics, 2d for starters
